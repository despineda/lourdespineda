			<p class="pa1"> <font color="white">Stanford student Stephanie Fleming invites her boyfriend Laird Mayhew over to "Netflix and chill". Meanwhile, back home in Grand Rapids, Stephanie's dad Ned is celebrating his 55th birthday with friends and family at an Applebee's restaurant. During a slideshow presentation in his honor, Stephanie drops in via webcam to congratulate him, when suddenly her boyfriend walks in on her and flashes the camera.

			Stephanie drives her family (her parents Ned and Barb and her fifteen-year-old brother Scotty) to Laird's huge house to meet him. She explains to Ned that Laird is the CEO of a video game company, which has made him extremely wealthy. Laird gives the family a tour of his house, complete with curse words and overly complimenting Barb's looks in front of Ned. He even shows off a back tattoo that he got of the Flemings' Christmas card, with "Happy Holidays" written on the bottom. In the living room is a tank with a moose filled completely with its urine. The basement has a bowling alley that Laird built with a mural of Ned, complete with a "crotch-chop" pose of his.

			Ned talks to Stephanie about Laird's behavior and she asks him to give him a chance. Later, Laird invites Ned to go for a walk in the woods outside his house and asks Ned for his blessing to propose to Stephanie. Ned is quick to say no, which completely blindsides Laird since he was confident Ned would say yes. Laird promises to win him over.

			As the family gathers in Laird's living room for a Christmas party, Laird reveals that he bought Ned's struggling printing company as a gift to remove all his debts. Instead of expressing gratitude, Ned punches Laird in the face and they begin to fight. Stephanie and Barb are both angry at the men's behavior, and the family leaves Laird's home.

			<p class="pa2"> <font color="white">"Karma..." He muttered. I looked over at him as he smiled to himself.

			"Is a bitch. And so are you!" I joked. Aiden glanced up at me and glared before he smashed a spoonful of ice cream onto my face, rubbing cheek to cheek, down to my chin then up to my forehead. I just sat there, paralyzed.

			"Try calling me that again." He joked back, leaning forward so our faces were a few inches apart. I huffed, grabbed a napkin to wipe my face off. Only to fake him out so it seemed I wasn't going to strike. But when he wasn't paying attention, I flung a spoonful of ice cream onto his face. It hit him on the nose and eye. 

			I broke out laughing, moaning lightly as my ribs protested in pain. But it was too funny. Aiden took the ice cream in his mouth when it slid down to his lips. "Hmmm. Cookie dough." His eyes gleamed with lust and humor. 

			"You look handsome with ice cream on your face!" I giggled, reaching over to clean it. He stayed still, obviously liking my actions as he purred again. 



			Summer had a dream: To major in photography and travel around the world with her sister. Problem? She has an abusive father that won't give her up for the live of him. And when she meets Aiden, the leader of a pack sworn to kill rouges(which Summer and her family are) and becomes his mate, the trouble doubles. In love, what will Summer do? Stay tuned.</font></p>

			<p class="pa4"><font color="white">The film begins with Sophie, a popular illustrator for books, walking her daughters, Ruby and Elly, home from school. She suddenly remembers she forgot to turn off the iron, and rushes to get home. When she gets there, she finds that it was still hot, but someone had already switched it off. Eventually dismissing it as a lapse of memory, she continues her daily routine of taking care of her two daughters and working on her next painting. While she's working, her husband, Craig, sends a singing telegram with flowers as an anniversary gift.

			Later, while fixing dinner, Sophie senses that someone is in the house, but shrugs it off. Then Elly complains of the same feeling, and being frightened of it. Sophie has a look around and seems to notice things just slightly out of place, but again decides it's nothing of concern. Later, she has to pick up Craig because he has lost his keys. Sophie continues to feel on edge that night during their anniversary dinner. The next day, she finds one of her paintings destroyed and assumes her cat knocked over the inkwell.

			She soon meets Mara, her husband's new co-worker, at a party. Mara and Sophie leave the party for a walk to the beach, where they have a talk. Mara offers Sophie her sympathy for her mother's passing, telling her she can relate because she lost her best friend, Kate, who had been an aid worker with orphans in Kosovo. She told Sophie that someone threw a Molotov cocktail through the window of the orphanage, and Kate burned to death trying to save the babies.
