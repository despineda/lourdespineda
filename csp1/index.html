			<p class="p1">There once was a very popular question on the internet:
			If one morning, you woke up and realized that your gender had changed, 
			what would be your first reaction?
			And someone on the internet had famously responded:
			First, give your bros a good time!
			Su Jian remembered that when he saw this reply, he had slapped the
			table to express his admiration. What a good bro! Such loyalty!
			But now that he actually encountered this strange situation himself, he could only feel an extremely ball-breaking alarm, shocked grief, and frightened anger. Fuck your mom! Ah, Fuck! Fuck it!
			Oh, a correction. The above is grammatically incorrect. After all, poor Classmate Su Jian doesnâ€™t have balls anymore.</p>

			<p class="p2">Siya si Zylie. Hindi siya clumsy, galit lang siguro sa kanya ang sahig, bully lang talaga ang mga mesa't upuan. At yung mga pader? Humaharang lang talaga sila ng kusa sa daanan niya. Yan ang palagi niyang biro. Kasi nga, ang sabi nila, siya daw ang Reyna ng Kamalasan. Pero nang dumating ang eidolon ng school na si Silver Jeremy Torres sa buhay niya, isa rin ba itong malas na kailangan niyang iwasan?</p>

			<p class="p3">The story is about a cheerful high school student named Han Ye-won (Jung Da-bin). She is a sweet, clumsy and warm girl. On the other hand, there is Ji Eun-sung (Song Seung-heon), a student from a vocational school and a well-known bully. He is hot-tempered and rude but deep inside he longs to be loved.[4]

			One day, clumsily, Ye-won leaves a message on the school website to reply to Eun-sung's impolite message. She is shocked when someone calls her cell phone and threatens her. Gradually, her best friend, Lee Kyung-won, tells her who Eun-sung is. He sends Ye-won a text message: He will wait for her in front of the main gate. She is so scared that she and Kyung-won decide to jump over the school wall. Unfortunately, the moment Ye-won jumps, Eun-sung is standing exactly at the other side of wall. She falls on him and their lips meet accidentally. Raising his voice, Eun-sung asks her to take responsibility; she is astonished. His friend explains that Eun-sung has never even held hands with a girl. Since she is the first girl who kissed him, as a consequence, she must marry him.</p>
